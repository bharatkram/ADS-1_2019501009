que implementation in arrays:
-  would be a waste of memory as the first element has to be made null everytime we deque.
- if taken two variables head and last and implemented, we have a problem of resizing when array is full.

que implementation in linked list:
- we have to take two fields first and last(for constant time complexity during enque) which would be one field more
    for the same time complexity as here(waste of memory again).
